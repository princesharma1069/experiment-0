Aim: Introduction to Python
Theory:Python uses the print() function to display output to the console. Variables act as named containers for storing data values, such as numbers or text, and are created the moment you assign a value to them using the = operator. Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare the data type explicitly
algorithm:
1)Start the program.
2)Assign a value (string or number) to a specific variable name.
3)Pass the variable or a direct string into the print() function.
4)Execute the code to display the result on the screen.
5)Stop the program.
conclusion: In this experiment, We learned the basic syntax of Python and how to use variables for data storage. We successfully used the print() statement to output information, forming the foundation for writing more complex scripts.
